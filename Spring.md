# Spring

Spring is a framework and ecosystem for building enterprise grade applications that run on a JVM (Java Virtual Machine). a JVM is the environment that Java applications run in within another OS like Linux.

So:

- Spring is Java based
- Spring builds apps that can perform at great scale with high reliability

Spring is a growing ecosystem of features, plugins and libraries that help you build powerful real-world applications easily. To components of the Spring ecosystem to focus on early are SpringBoot and Spring Tool Suite.

SpringBoot
SpringBoot is a stand-alone container for running Spring apps. If you’ve worked with Java web applications before you’ll now that configuring and running a server is a hassle, SpringBoot alleviates that confusion.

Spring Tool Suite
Spring Tool Suite (STS) is an IDE specifically designed for working with Spring, it’s based on Eclipse which is an excellent open source, long lived and very popular IDE for Java development.

Java
Java is a general-purpose computing language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform.

The main thing Spring brings to the table is  dependency-injection which is a pattern that allows to build very decoupled systems. Like composer with PHP, and NPM/RequireJS/Webpack, etc. with JavaScript.

Spring has a lot of great documentation and tutorials for getting started. The first thing to do is install Spring Tools Suite:

Then load up one of the getting started tutorials and follow along:
